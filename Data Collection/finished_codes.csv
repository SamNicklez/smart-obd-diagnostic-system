Any feedback will be much appreciated.
Thanks Mike..., can an oil change for a c300 make the code p0170 and p0173 come out?Yea I recently changed my mercedes oil and the air filters, and right after, approximately 40 miles, my engine light came on.. codes p0170 and p0173.. is there any way I could've put something back wrong? Or does this have nothing to do with those codes? I would like some feed back please, I don'..., 1999 Acura RL p0151 p0150 p0173 p0174Hi I have a 1999 acura 3.5 rl.
